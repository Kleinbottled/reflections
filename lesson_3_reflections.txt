When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

	Almost all the time it would be useful simply as insurance against
	disk failure or whatnot. Beyond that it allows you to work from
	multiple locations. Also allows for more easy collaboration with
	others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Many of the same reasons it isn't good to commit/ save randomly
	only more so. Why would you want the stuff you are working on to
	change as you are working on it? You seriously might lose your
	mind.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When
would you use one instead of another?

	A clone is a straight up copy. To make a branch, a clone is
	modified and the changes are saved in a commit under a different
	branch name, leaving the master (or other original) unchanged.
	That branch is local only unless one pushes it to a remote such as
	GitHuB. Once a new branch is on GitHub, we might think of it as
	informally forked. Offical forking is a function that happens
	internally at the GitHub level. A Clone is made of the repository
	within GitHub itself, with pointers refering back to the original
	project. Best to fork if you are trying to collaberate. Allows for
	pull requests.
